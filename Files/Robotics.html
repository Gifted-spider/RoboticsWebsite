              This week I learned about mechanical engineering and the different tytpes of simple machines.
              On Wednesday, we did our first Wednesday challenge where we tried to make boats powered by rubber bands. 
              I used a propeller type of motor, but it didn't work because it got caught on the edge of the container
              My team got the closest and were the default winners as we were the only ones who were able to use
              rubber bands. Today, we started on our first lab where we're making a Rube Goldburg machine
              to pop a balloon.

            This week I worked on my Rube Goldburg machine. I'm almost finished! All I have to do is set up the pulley! We also did a weekly
            challenge where we had to measure and cut a pice of wood using the saw. I was very happy that the cover was on the table saw.
            I learned that in order to cut things straight you have to meaure at least three points. I also learned that if you are stuck,
            it is best if you stop and think about the problem instead of imediatly getting stressed. I really enjoyed getting to do hands 
            on activities and learn throught trial and error!

                    This week I finished my Rube Goldburg machine! The challenge was to start with a baseball and end with popping a balloon. 
                We had to use 2-3 simple machines. The baseball goes down an incline place into a cardboard car. Then, the car would slam into a small
                box, which would in turn hit a bigger box with a string attached. This box was in a tunnel of cardboard with a rectangular hole on the top.
                Once the box was hit, The pulley would be triggered, making another baseball drop onto a wedge. The needle was attached to the wedge and slammed
                on top of the balloon, popping it.
                    
                    One of the biggest problems I had to solve was how to get the box with the string 
                to not fly off because of the weight of the baseball on the pulley. I eventually used a piece of cardboard that was a little too big 
                for the cut to stop the box. It could then be pushed our when the box was hit. I also had many problems with taping the carboard before it was 
                all the way cut.

                This week we learned about electrical engineering. It was really interesting. We learned about AC DC currents, parallel and series
                which is what the band is named after, and how electricity works. We had a great conversation about grounding electricty and what that means.
                A person's car could get hit by lightning and they would survive inside of it! (as long as they weren't touching metal) 
                I learned that electicity is very fickle and sort of like magic and that definately make me like it more.
                Our project this week was to use breadbords to turn LEDs on and off. I shorted out 3 LEDs (one exploded and had an electrical fire) 
                and broke the leg of one other. :( We then used arduinos to program the lights to turn on or off at different times. It was very dificult to
                get the wires to go from power back to ground and I kept confusing myself. I learned that sometimes you have to rip everything out and start over
                to be more organised and solve it.

                This week we continued wiring our breadboards and coding our aurduinos. We added a motor!
                The motor was really fast and kind of scary. It actually was starting to cut through the 
                wires at one point. I did not expode anything this time. We also added a relay which was 
                confusing at first, but eventually we figured it out. When we added a second motor, it 
                stopped working. We figured out that the METAL thing we were using to hold the motors up was
                screwing with it and conducting electricity!

                This week we worked on our end of the year projects. We have a project proposal now.
                I did lots of reasearch on plants and learned that humidity is a big problem for plants because
                they aren't able to breathe. That might be a big problem for my project, but I've come up with a few salutions 
                for it. We also did a Wednesday challenge where we calculated how long it would take to 
                write up to one million. Mushegh got the closest to the number Mr. Poole got. We also had to see which one would
                be better- writing up to one million or taking a math class. Amelia was the only person who said they'd 
                write up to one million. We then had a mini challenge to see who could make the longest bridge with
                fifteen sticky notes. I tried to stick all the corners together and take advantage of triangles, and it would have
                probabaly been the longest, if it didn't keep falling apart.

                This week we started on our final project. We are working in groups and have to make a stable bridge out of spaghetti and wood glue.
                Our design is to have broken spagetti (at 2.5 inches) and alternate the glue parts with the middle of noodle. We had run some tests 
                on the noodles obseving where the noddles were the strongest and what length of noodle was the strongest.
                We found that the glue actually made the noodles less strong, which was the opposite of our original hypothesis.
                We also found that shorter noodles were stronger, as there was less space to bend. In order to counteract the bendy glue problem. I 
                had the idea to alternate the glue with pure noodle. We also thought to have a rail with shorter noodles to support the entire bridge.

                This week we were working on our final project to build a bridge. We created a prototype and got to test it.
                It held a LOT more weight than we expected. It broke at a red cup of water. It broke at the middle then the sides,
                then finally at the diagonal, which collasped the bridge. We decided to improve the bridge by
                using less and neater glue, along with making the bridge thinner and spacing it out in smaller sections. We also added 
                suppports on the top.

                 Last semester we tried the bridges for real. Our original design didn't hold much water, but the 
                 tiny ones we had made in one day worked really well. They were really thin with a bunch of 
                 glue at the joints. The glue hadn't fully hardened, so intead of snapping, like our 
                 original design, it bent, and held a lot of water. Amelia and I won the competition with our thick bridge.
                 The person who was supposed to be holding the water 
                 dropped it and it fell all over the carpet, so we moved it outside. Then the same thing happened with a 
                 different person, but it drenched my shoes.
