          Today we went to the Robotics room for a tour. 
          We saw the CAD room and Preston and I explained the Island Insanity game. 
          We then came back to the classroom to work on our websites.

          This week I learned about the engineering process, which was really interesting. We also thought of different 
          ways to create robots. Then, I got sick, so I stayed home. I worked on my homework and drew.
