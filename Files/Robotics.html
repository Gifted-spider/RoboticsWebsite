          Today we went to the Robotics room for a tour. 
          We saw the CAD room and Preston and I explained the Island Insanity game. 
          We then came back to the classroom to work on our websites.

          This week I learned about the engineering process, which was really interesting. We also thought of different 
          ways to create robots. Then, I got sick, so I stayed home. I worked on my homework and drew.

              This week I learned about mechanical engineering and the different tytpes of simple machines.
              On Wednesday, we did our first Wednesday challenge where we tried to make boats powered by rubber bands. 
              I used a propeller type of motor, but it didn't work because it got caught on the edge of the container
              My team got the closest and were the default winners as we were the only ones who were able to use
              rubber bands. Today, we started on our first lab where we're making a Rube Goldburg machine
              to pop a balloon.

            This week I worked on my Rube Goldburg machine. I'm almost finished! All I have to do is set up the pulley! We also did a weekly
            challenge where we had to measure and cut a pice of wood using the saw. I was very happy that the cover was on the table saw.
            I learned that in order to cut things straight you have to meaure at least three points. I also learned that if you are stuck,
            it is best if you stop and think about the problem instead of imediatly getting stressed. I really enjoyed getting to do hands 
            on activities and learn throught trial and error!
