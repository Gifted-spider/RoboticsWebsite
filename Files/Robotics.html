          Today we went to the Robotics room for a tour. 
          We saw the CAD room and Preston and I explained the Island Insanity game. 
          We then came back to the classroom to work on our websites.

          This week I learned about the engineering process, which was really interesting. We also thought of different 
          ways to create robots. Then, I got sick, so I stayed home. I worked on my homework and drew.

              This week I learned about mechanical engineering and the different tytpes of simple machines.
              On Wednesday, we did our first Wednesday challenge where we tried to make boats powered by rubber bands.
              My team got the closest and were the default winners as we were the only ones who were able to use
              rubber bands. Today, we started on our first lab where we're making a Rube Goldburg machine
              to pop a balloon.
