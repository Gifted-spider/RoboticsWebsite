          Today we went to the Robotics room for a tour. 
          We saw the CAD room and Preston and I explained the Island Insanity game. 
          We then came back to the classroom to work on our websites.

          This week I learned about the engineering process, which was really interesting. We also thought of different 
          ways to create robots. Then, I got sick, so I stayed home. I worked on my homework and drew.

              This week I learned about mechanical engineering and the different tytpes of simple machines.
              On Wednesday, we did our first Wednesday challenge where we tried to make boats powered by rubber bands. 
              I used a propeller type of motor, but it didn't work because it got caught on the edge of the container
              My team got the closest and were the default winners as we were the only ones who were able to use
              rubber bands. Today, we started on our first lab where we're making a Rube Goldburg machine
              to pop a balloon.

            This week I worked on my Rube Goldburg machine. I'm almost finished! All I have to do is set up the pulley! We also did a weekly
            challenge where we had to measure and cut a pice of wood using the saw. I was very happy that the cover was on the table saw.
            I learned that in order to cut things straight you have to meaure at least three points. I also learned that if you are stuck,
            it is best if you stop and think about the problem instead of imediatly getting stressed. I really enjoyed getting to do hands 
            on activities and learn throught trial and error!

                    This week I finished my Rube Goldburg machine! The challenge was to start with a baseball and end with popping a balloon. 
                We had to use 2-3 simple machines. The baseball goes down an incline place into a cardboard car. Then, the car would slam into a small
                box, which would in turn hit a bigger box with a string attached. This box was in a tunnel of cardboard with a rectangular hole on the top.
                Once the box was hit, The pulley would be triggered, making another baseball drop onto a wedge. The needle was attached to the wedge and slammed
                on top of the balloon, popping it.
                    
                    One of the biggest problems I had to solve was how to get the box with the string 
                to not fly off because of the weight of the baseball on the pulley. I eventually used a piece of cardboard that was a little too big 
                for the cut to stop the box. It could then be pushed our when the box was hit. I also had many problems with taping the carboard before it was 
                all the way cut.

                This week we learned about electrical engineering. It was really interesting. We learned about AC DC currents, parallel and series
                which is what the band is named after, and how electricity works. We had a great conversation about grounding electricty and what that means.
                A person's car could get hit by lightning and they would survive inside of it! (as long as they weren't touching metal) 
                I learned that electicity is very fickle and sort of like magic and that definately make me like it more.
                Our project this week was to use breadbords to turn LEDs on and off. I shorted out 3 LEDs (one exploded and had an electrical fire) 
                and broke the leg of one other. :( We then used arduinos to program the lights to turn on or off at different times. It was very dificult to
                get the wires to go from power back to ground and I kept confusing myself. I learned that sometimes you have to rip everything out and start over
                to be more organised and solve it.

                This week we continued wiring our breadboards and coding our aurduinos. We added a motor!
                The motor was really fast and kind of scary. It actually was starting to cut through the 
                wires at one point. I did not expode anything this time. We also added a relay which was 
                confusing at first, but eventually we figured it out. When we added a second motor, it 
                stopped working. We figured out that the METAL thing we were using to hold the motors up was
                screwing with it and conducting electricity!
