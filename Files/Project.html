                So far, I've sketched a redesign of my project and started cading it. I also 
                did more research on hydroponic systems and desided how to fix my problem from last year.
                I needed to have seedlings instead of seeds, as the amount of water was drowing them. In addition,
                its not possible to fully submerge the roots unless there is air for them. I'll need to 
                get an air stone, which would fix this problem, in addtion to making sure the nutrients don't settle
                on the bottom. I'll be using a water culture system as the hydroponic system. The project will be 
                making a single plant system for indoor plants that takes care of the plant by itself. This week I plan on 
                finishing the cad and starting to update the list of materials I need.
