                So far, I've sketched a redesign of my project and started cading it. I also 
                did more research on hydroponic systems and desided how to fix my problem from last year.
                I needed to have seedlings instead of seeds, as the amount of water was drowing them. In addition,
                its not possible to fully submerge the roots unless there is air for them. I'll need to 
                get an air stone, which would fix this problem, in addtion to making sure the nutrients don't settle
                on the bottom. I'll be using a water culture system as the hydroponic system. The project will be 
                making a single plant system for indoor plants that takes care of the plant by itself. This week I plan on 
                finishing the cad and starting to update the list of materials I need.

                This week I finished the cad and designing the project, as well as being very close to finishing the list of 
                materials! I am still using most of the materials from last year, unfortunatly, due to the redesign I will need to get some different materials.
                I also updated my project proposal, which the link "project proposal" links to. This week I plan on finalizing my material list
                and putting together a rough schedule of my timeline. It would include around when I'd need to use the shop.

                get here in time.

                This week I finished the timeline. I also started on the slides for the presentation of my project.
                I have most of the slides about my research and first design of my project finished. I also downloaded a 
                template for the slides to make them look good as well. Next week I hope to finish the presentation and 
                present it at some time. I also hope to be able to restart coding my project, but I'm not sure
                how that is going to work as the computer I had all the code on is in Mr. Poole's room and I don't remember the 
                number. I can also start wiring my project, as I have most of what I need here.

                thinking of different ways it could fail. I would also like to figure out when I would be able to get
                to the shop to start building the design.

                Seeing as I will not be able to get to the shop durring class time, I may do my smaller project instead.
                I have been working on a game in Unity. It is about a post-apocolyptic city overrun by magic-tech corrupted 
                monsters. The point of the game is to pick up magic orbs and fight the monsters, while trying to find the 
                other survivors. The past couple of weeks I have worked on setting up the backgrounds, coding the player-character,
                and coding the enemies. I started on the magic orbs, but I wasn't able to make it work quite like how I wanted it.
                I also was doing research on how to code some of the systems I want in the game. I will link my notes page at the top. 
                In the next two weeks I hope to make and add most of the animations for the player-character and enemies.
