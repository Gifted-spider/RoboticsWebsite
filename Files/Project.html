                So far, I've sketched a redesign of my project and started cading it. I also 
                did more research on hydroponic systems and desided how to fix my problem from last year.
                I needed to have seedlings instead of seeds, as the amount of water was drowing them. In addition,
                its not possible to fully submerge the roots unless there is air for them. I'll need to 
                get an air stone, which would fix this problem, in addtion to making sure the nutrients don't settle
                on the bottom. I'll be using a water culture system as the hydroponic system. The project will be 
                making a single plant system for indoor plants that takes care of the plant by itself. This week I plan on 
                finishing the cad and starting to update the list of materials I need.

                This week I finished the cad and designing the project, as well as being very close to finishing the list of 
                materials! I am still using most of the materials from last year, unfortunatly, due to the redesign I will need to get some different materials.
                I also updated my project proposal, which the link "project proposal" links to. This week I plan on finalizing my material list
                and putting together a rough schedule of my timeline. It would include around when I'd need to use the shop.
